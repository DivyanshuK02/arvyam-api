# Deploy — Render Web Service (minimal)

This project deploys as a **Render Web Service**. Keep deployment knobs out of README to avoid drift; this page is the single source for deploy basics.

## Service settings
- **Service type:** Web Service
- **Runtime:** Python 3.11
- **Region:** (choose closest to your users)
- **Auto-deploy:** From `main` branch (recommended)

## Commands
**Build:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start:**
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

> Render supplies `$PORT`. No other env vars are required for v1.

## Notes
- Public API v1 is **packaging-blind**: no `packaging` or `luxury_grand` leaves the server.
- CI must be green before deploy (contract + guards + golden harness).
- Rollback = deploy a prior commit from Render’s “Manual Deploy” (no code changes needed).

## Pre-deploy checklist
- `pytest -q` passes locally.
- Evidence/artifacts generated by the golden harness (optional for prod).
- No changes to public schema (v1 freeze).
